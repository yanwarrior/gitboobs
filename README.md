# Gitboobs
Simple application to learn about PWA by using the `Github API` and `Vue`. 
This application displays your Github profile along with a list of your followers and repos.

## Demo
If you want to know whether this application is PWA, you might be able to access the following URL.

When the page is loaded in your smartphone browser, a notification will appear to add it to your desktop.

## Quick Review
